# Mastering Java for Data Science

This is the unofficial code repository for the book 
["Mastering Java for Data Science"](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-java-data-science) 
by Alexey Grigorev (i.e. me).
The official repository is located [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Java-for-Data-Science), 
but might not contain the most recent updates.

This repository contains the code examples for the following chapters:

- Chapter 02: Data Processing Toolbox
- Chapter 03: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Chapter 04: Supervised Learning - Classification and Regression
- Chapter 05: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Chapter 06: Working with Text - Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval
- Chapter 07: Extreme Gradient Boosting
- Chapter 08: Deep Learning with DeepLearning4J
- Chapter 09: Scaling Data Science
- Chapter 10: Deploying Data Science Models

The code might be a bit messy - please let me know (by creating an issue) if something is not clear, I'll be happy to assist.
